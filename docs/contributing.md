# Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you would like to report issues, suggest improvements, or add new features, please follow these guidelines to contribute:

1.	**Fork the Repository**: Click the “Fork” button on the project’s GitHub page to create your own copy of the repository. Clone your fork to your local machine for development.

2.	**Create a Feature Branch**: Before making changes, create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName
```

Use a descriptive branch name that identifies the feature or fix.

3.	**Implement Your Changes**: Write clear, well-documented code. Try to adhere to the existing code style and project structure. If you add new files, place them in the appropriate directory (models, services, etc.). Keep your functions and classes focused and document any complex logic with comments.

4.	**Test Thoroughly**: Before committing, run the app and test your changes. Ensure that all existing features still work as expected (no regressions). If the project has unit tests or widget tests, run them (flutter test) to verify nothing is broken. Consider writing new tests for any new functionality you add.

5.	**Commit and Push**: Commit your changes with a clear commit message explaining what you did and why. Push the branch to your fork on GitHub.

6.	**Open a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository and open a Pull Request from your fork’s feature branch. Provide a descriptive title and detailed description of your changes in the PR. Explain the problem your contribution addresses or the feature it adds. If there are related issues, reference them in the PR description.

7.	**Code Review**: Collaborate with the maintainers by responding to any code review comments. You might be asked to make adjustments; this is a normal part of the review process to maintain code quality.

8.	**Merge**: Once your PR is approved by the maintainers, it will be merged into the main codebase. You can then sync your fork’s main branch with the upstream repository.

## Additional Tips:

•   Follow the Flutter and Dart best practices. Format your code using dartfmt (or flutter format) and analyze for any linter warnings.

•   Keep contributions focused. If you plan multiple distinct features, prefer separate branches and PRs for each, rather than one large PR.

•   Update documentation: If your contribution changes how a feature works or adds a new feature, consider updating the README or any in-app help text to reflect that.

By following these guidelines, you help ensure the project remains maintainable and that your contributions can be integrated smoothly. Thank you for taking the time to contribute!
