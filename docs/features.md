# Features

•	**Add, Edit, and Manage Items**: Create new inventory items with details like name, description, quantity, location, etc. Edit existing items or delete them as needed through a simple user interface.

•	**QR Code Scanning**: Use your device’s camera to scan QR codes associated with inventory items. Scanning a QR code quickly pulls up the corresponding item’s details, making it easy to retrieve information or verify stock.

•	**Full-Text Search with Filters**: Quickly find items using a search bar that supports full-text search through item names and descriptions. Apply filters by **position** (physical location or section) or **environment** (e.g., warehouse, office, cold storage) to narrow down search results and find exactly what you need.

•	**Database Sharing**: The app provides a settings option to share or export the SQLite database file. This allows you to back up your data or transfer the entire inventory to another device. For example, you can email the database file or upload it to cloud storage for safekeeping or collaborative use.

•	**Bluetooth Printing Support** (optional): If you have a compatible Bluetooth thermal printer, the app can connect to it and print inventory labels or summaries. This is useful for printing QR code labels for items or generating receipts of the current inventory list.
